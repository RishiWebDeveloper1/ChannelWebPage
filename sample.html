      <center><em><u><strong>AGE OF ULTRON</strong></u><em>
            <center>
              <p>At one point in "Avengers: Age of Ultron," the hammer-swinging superhero Thor <a
                  href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth>(Chris Hemsworth)</a> tells the android villain
                Ultron <a href=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Spader>(James Spader)</a> that “there’s no need to
                break anything.” “Clearly you’ve never made an omelet,” Ultron replies. It's nice when a movie hands you
                a metaphor like that. The second “Avengers” is a gigantic omelet combining everything in writer-director
                Joss Whedon's refrigerator, pantry and spice rack, and dozens of eggs are broken in its creation. This
                film about a team of good guys battling a brilliant, genocidal robot is bigger, louder and more
                disjointed than the first "Avengers”—which, like this new installment, was a crescendo picture, meant to
                merge strands from solo superhero movies within the Marvel Universe. But it’s also got more
                personality—specifically Whedon’s—than any other film in the now seven-year-old franchise. And in its
                growing pains you can see a future in which these corporate movies might indeed be art, or at least
                unique expressions, rather than monotonous quarterly displays of things crashing into other things, with
                splashes of personality designed to fool people into thinking they're not just widgets stamped out in
                Marvel's hit factory.



                <br>Captain America and Tony Stark/Iron Man are at the heart of this one. They’re always more intriguing
                when set against each other than when they’re claiming the spotlight in their own movies, but Whedon,
                who also serves as a consultant and dialogue polisher on other Marvel entries, has taken their conflict
                a step further by drawing on events in “Iron Man 3” and “Captain America: The Winter Soldier.” It’s
                Stark who creates the titular bad guy—with the reluctant help of scientist and part-time Hulk Bruce
                Banner—in response to trauma he suffered while battling Thor’s brother Loki and his extraterrestrial
                allies in the first “Avengers.” Ultron is supposed to serve as a Skynet-like artificial intelligence
                network that detects apocalyptic threats and swiftly destroys them. Cap saw the horrific outgrowth of
                this mentality in the second “Captain America," in which millions of alleged terrorists were nearly
                wiped out by S.H.I.E.L.D. in simultaneous extra-judicial assassinations. Cap is appalled both by the
                Ultron project itself and the fact that Stark started it in secret because he “didn’t want to hear the
                ‘man-is-not-meant-to-meddle medley’” from his fellow Avengers. He was right to worry. Like many a sci-fi
                robot or Frankenstein’s monster, the creature has a different idea of what constitutes a threat
                (spoiler: it’s us).
